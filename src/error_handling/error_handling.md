# Error handling

1. Most errors aren’t serious enough to require the program to stop entirely.
2. Sometimes, when a function fails, it’s for a reason that you can easily interpret and respond to.

> For example, if you try to open a file and that operation fails because the file doesn’t exist, you might want to create the file instead of terminating the process.

## Is Option<T> part of error handling

> In Rust, an "option" is not technically part of error handling, but it is often used in combination with error handling to represent the possibility of a value being absent or "None."

1. An "option" is a type that represents either Some value or None.

- When a function may not return a value, it can return an Option<T> where T is the type of the value that might be returned.
- If the function succeeds and returns a value, it returns Some(value); otherwise, it returns None.

> Error handling in Rust typically uses the Result<T, E> type

- where T is the type of the value that is returned if the operation succeeds
- and E is the type of the error that may occur.
- When an error occurs, a value of type E is returned, and when the operation succeeds, a value of type T is returned.

> So while Option and Result are different types in Rust, they are often used in combination to handle situations where a value may or may not be present or when an operation may or may not succeed.
