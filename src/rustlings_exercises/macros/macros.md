# Macros

Rust's macro system is very powerful, but also kind of difficult to wrap your
head around. We're not going to teach you how to write your own fully-featured
macros. Instead, we'll show you how to use and create them.

If you'd like to learn more about writing your own macros, the
[macrokata](https://github.com/tfpk/macrokata) project has a similar style
of exercises to Rustlings, but is all about learning to write Macros.
